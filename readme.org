* About
This is a spack repository for working with customized remotes. The basic use case is with LUMI.

** Usage
This assumes LUMI. Other instructions will differ.

#+begin_src bash
cd $LUMI_PROJ # project/project_ID
gh repo clone amritagos/agSpackRepos
gh repo clone spack/spack mySpack
gh repo clone lumi-supercomputer/lumi-spack-settings
cp lumi-spack-settings/22.08/0.18.1-user/*.yaml $HOME/.spack/linux/
# Now add
. mySpack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
spack repo add agSpackRepos
#+end_src

The key idea is to copy and modify ~package.py~ files for use. The namespace is ~ag.spack~ and finding things is simply by inspecting the ~packages~ folder.

#+begin_src bash
tree packages
spack find -N # Show namespaces
#+end_src

** Supported Applications

Currently we have:

#+begin_src bash
ag.spack.lammps @newR4LJ
#+end_src

Followed by the regular options. So something like:

#+begin_src bash
spack install ag.spack.lammps @newR4LJ %cce@14.0.2 +asphere +body +class2 +colloid +compress +coreshell  +dipole +granular +kspace +manybody +mc +misc +molecule +mpiio +peri +python +qeq +replica +rigid +shock +snap +spin +srd +user-reaxc +user-misc ~kim
#+end_src

~kokkos~ will conflict without the suggested version.
~kim~ fails with ~cce~ somehow

Now that we have this we can use it:

#+begin_src bash
spack load lammps@newR4LJ%cce@14.0.2
#+end_src

To use this in a scripted manner the steps are then:

#+begin_src bash
cd $LUMI_PROJ
source mySpack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
spack load lammps@newR4LJ%cce@14.0.2
# The lmp binary is now present
#+end_src
