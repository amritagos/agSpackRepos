* About
This is a spack repository for working with customized remotes. The basic use case is with LUMI.

** Usage
This assumes LUMI. Other instructions will differ.

```bash
cd $LUMI_PROJ # project/project_ID
gh repo clone amritagos/agSpackRepos
gh repo clone spack/spack mySpack
gh repo clone lumi-supercomputer/lumi-spack-settings
cp lumi-spack-settings/22.08/0.18.1-user/*.yaml $HOME/.spack/linux/
# Now add
. mySpack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
spack repo add agSpackRepos
```

The key idea is to copy and modify ~package.py~ files for use.
